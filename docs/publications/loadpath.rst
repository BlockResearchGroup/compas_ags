**Abstract**

This paper describes the use of load-path optimisation for discrete compression vaults. The presented
approach allows for the finding of the funicular solution for a network layout defined in plan, that has
the lowest volume for the given boundary conditions. The compression-only thrust networks are constructed
with Thrust Network Analysis by assigning force densities to the network's independent edges. By defining
a load-path function and deriving its associated gradient and Hessian functions, optimisation routines
were used to find the optimum independent force densities that minimised the load-path function subject to
compression only restraints. A selection of example cases showed a dependence of the optimum load-path and
force distribution on the network topology. Appropriate selection of the network pattern encouraged the flow
of compression forces such that efficient vaulting action could form internally, avoiding long network edges
with high force densities. A general, non-orthogonal network example showed that vaulted structures of high
network indeterminacy can be investigated both directly for weight minimisation, and for the understanding
of efficient thrust network patterns within the structure.
