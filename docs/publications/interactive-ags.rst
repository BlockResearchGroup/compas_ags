**Abstract**

This paper presents an interactive implementation of graphic statics, which can be
integrated into a CAD environment.
Graphic statics is a well-known design and analysis method for two-dimensional discrete
structures that rely on geometrical rather than an analytical representation of the relation
between the structure's geometry and the equilibrium of its internal forces. The method was
formalised in the 19th century but slowly disappeared from structural engineering practice
over the 20th century.
Recent developments have introduced Algebraic Graph Statics (AGS), which formulates the
geometrical relationship between the graph representations of the reciprocal form and force
diagrams in graphic statics using linear algebra.
AGS and its extensions enable automatic construction of force diagrams from given form diagrams
and allow a few basic modifications of the force diagram from which the form diagram is updated.
This paper builds on the previous work of AGS by implementing a real-time, bi-directional
workflow allowing users to impose various constraints, and perform geometrical modifications
in either the form or force diagram from which the other is automatically updated by using an
iterative geometric solver.
The presented implementation of interactive AGS provides a robust computational back-end to
harness the advantages of traditional graphic statics for geometry-based teaching and design of structures.
