Graphic Statics
===============

Graphic statics is a well-known method for analysis and design of two-dimensional
structures based on Cremonaâ€™s extensions of Maxwell's theory of reciprocal figures [1,2].
In graphicstatics, the relation between form and forces of a structural system
is contained in the reciprocal relation between two diagrams. A form diagram describes
the geometrical configuration of the (axial) internal and external forces of a two-dimensional
structural system, and a force diagram represents their equilibrium. The combination
of these two diagrams allows for an intuitive evaluation of structural behaviour,
performance and efficiency at a glance. The graphical nature of the method furthermore allows
for a visual verification of both the evaluation process and results [3,4], making it
more transparent than arithmetic or numerical methods.
