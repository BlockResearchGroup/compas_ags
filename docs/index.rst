:mod:`compas_ags` is a computational implementation of Algebraic Graph(ic) Statics (AGS) for and based on the COMPAS framework.
AGS is an algebraic approach to graphic statics.
With AGS, form and force diagrams can be generated automatically from both numerical and geometric inputs.
The reciprocal relationship between the diagrams is encoded in dual meshes, with geometric constraints imposed on the coordinates of their vertices.
This allows for a parametric exploration of the relationship between form and forces in two-dimensional structural systems,
and for the combination of graphic statics with traditional optimisation methods.
