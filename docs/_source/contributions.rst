Unlike the **COMPAS** framework, which provides a broad computational base to be used
for various academic explorations related to architecture, structures and fabrication,
add-ons such as :mod:`compas_ags` are meant to be implementations of specific research
topics. Preferably, this research is published in peer-reviewed papers, which can
be added as references providing more information about the implementations.

Currently, :mod:`compas_ags` contains code related to three different papers
contributed by three different authors:

* *Algebraic Graph Statics*, by Van Mele and Block.
* *Load-path Optimisation of Funicular Networks*, by Liew et al.
* *B-directional algebraic graphic statics*, by Alic and Ã…kesson.
