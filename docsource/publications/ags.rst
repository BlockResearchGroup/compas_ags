**Abstract**

This paper presents a general, non-procedural, algebraic approach to graphical analysis of structures.
Using graph theoretical properties of reciprocal graphs, the geometrical relation between the form and
force diagrams used in graphic statics is written algebraically.
These formulations have been found to be equivalent to the equilibrium equations
used in matrix analysis of planar, self-stressed structural systems.
The significance and uses of this general approach are demonstrated through several
examples and it is shown that it provides a robust back-end for a real-time, interactive
and flexible computational implementation of traditional graphic statics.
