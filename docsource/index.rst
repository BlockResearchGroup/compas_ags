Graphic Statics
===============

Graphic statics is a well-known method for analysis and design of two-dimensional
structures based on Cremona’s extensions of
Maxwell’stheoryofreciprocalfigures[1,2].Ingraphicstatics,the
relation between form and forces of a structural system is con-
tained in the reciprocal relation between two diagrams. A form
diagramdescribesthegeometricalconfigurationofthe(axial)in-
ternalandexternalforcesofatwo-dimensionalstructuralsystem,
and a force diagram represents their equilibrium. The combina-
tion of these two diagrams allows for an intuitive evaluation of
structural behaviour, performance and efficiency at a glance. The
graphicalnatureofthemethodfurthermoreallowsforavisualver-
ificationofboththeevaluationprocessandresults[3,4],makingit
